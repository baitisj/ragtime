# Ragtime

A plain, friendly chat and file-transfer client for
[Data2G](https://github.com/arodland/Data2G), the HF data modem by Andrew
Rodland, KC2G. Ragtime is a sibling of
[Glissando](https://github.com/baitisj/glissando), Jeff Baitis's (AG7EW)
chirp-mode chat app, and is named for the same musical family and for the
ragchew.

Status: design done, Stage 1 under way. The app builds and opens an empty
window; nothing to use on the air yet.

## Building

On Ubuntu 24.04:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libwxgtk3.2-dev
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
    ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
    ./build/app/ragtime

## The idea

- **Welcome to the D2G net.** D2G is a net that never closes. You check
  in, net control asks for traffic, and the traffic gets passed. Every
  burst teaches the net who hears whom.
- **Sometimes we ragchew.** When operators want to talk, they enter a
  ragchew on purpose and leave it on purpose.

Ragtime is a front end for a separately running `data2g-host`, reached
over TCP. It never starts the modem and never touches the sound card.
Messages are signed, never encrypted, as Part 97 requires.
