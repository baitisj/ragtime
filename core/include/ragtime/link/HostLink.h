// HostLink: Ragtime's side of the conversation with data2g-host, with no
// sockets. The app connects the KISS and command ports, hands HostLink
// what arrives on them, and writes what it gives back; the session data
// port (the command port + 1) is the app's to read and write, through
// protocol::StreamReader.
//
// What it does:
// - Opening: MYCALL, CHAT ON, DATA2G ON, LISTEN, BW500 or BW2300, BCAST
//   OPEN D2G FROM <call>, then MODES. DATA2G ON (Data2G PR #118) asks for
//   host byte offsets in CLEANTXBUFFER's answers; a host from before it
//   answers WRONG, which is not refused, and sessions there go without
//   cuts.
// - The host's reports: PTT, BUSY, MODE, the MODES list, BCAST HEARD,
//   LOST, DROPPED and MISSED, CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, BUFFER. HEARD and
//   MISSED carry an SNR from hosts since Data2G PR #98.
// - The session partner's SNR: SN, asked when its bursts have likely
//   arrived (BUFFER going down, session bytes in), at most every
//   SN_GAP_MS. A host that answers WRONG (one before PR #98, or before the
//   partner's first burst) is not refused for it.
// - Broadcasts: one burst at a time to the D2G port, each frame with an
//   ACKMODE tag, after BCAST MODE when the burst wants another mode. A
//   burst is Sent once the host has acknowledged every tag, and Not sent
//   if it reports it dropped, the command port closes, or two minutes pass
//   without it going while no session is up (a session holds the group;
//   docs/PLAN.md, "Broadcast mode").
// - Sessions: Call (CONNECT), Leave (DISCONNECT) and Leave now (ABORT).
//   Nothing else opens or closes one. With DATA2G ON, CLEANTXBUFFER n
//   drops what the host holds of our session bytes before offset n and
//   hasn't sent (a cut), and its answers and SETTLED reports come back as
//   Clean events.
//
// The time is always passed in, so tests run it on a simulated clock.
